# Teensy ControlPad Driver

In the end I did not use this driver for my midi looper, because I could not get the led brightness/flickering updates to stabilize enough. 
The main problem is it requires 3x 64bits to be send every 40ms to update ALL leds with a very strict timing.

I tried using an usb shield 2 host which does not have periodic cleanups like the imxrt does but only runs at 1ms max.
 
After many clock timing tests, It still dims all leds every 5 seocnds after every 55 seconds which is really annoying, because the rest worked fine!

The working code using the USB Shield with no the led dimmings using 40us updates can be found in this branch:

## 🔧 Advanced Technical Details

### **Complete 5-Command LED Protocol**
The LED control protocol was fully reverse-engineered through extensive USB capture analysis:

```
Complete LED Control Sequence (5 Commands):
1. Custom Mode Setup:  56 81 00 00 01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 bb bb bb bb...
2. LED Data Package 1: 56 83 00 00 [Button data for commands 1-13]
3. LED Data Package 2: 56 83 01 00 [Button data for commands 14-24] 
4. Apply Command:      41 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00...
5. Finalize Command:   51 28 00 00 ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00...
```

### **Critical Button Data Layout Discovery**
Through protocol analysis, the exact button mapping was discovered:

**Command 2 (LED Data Package 1):**
- Buttons: 1,6,11,16,21 → 2,7,12,17,22 → 3,8,13,18(partial)
- Structure: 5 buttons × RGB, 5 buttons × RGB, 4 buttons + partial RGB

**Command 3 (LED Data Package 2):**
- Buttons: 18(completion),23 → 4,9,14,19,24 → 5,10,15,20
- Critical: Button 18 spans both commands (R in cmd2, G,B in cmd3)

### **Failsafe Prevention Solution**
**Major Achievement**: Solved the device failsafe/static mode issue by implementing complete LED state management:

- **Problem**: Setting individual buttons while leaving others undefined (0,0,0) triggered device failsafe
- **Solution**: Implemented baseline color scheme for all 24 buttons using sophisticated gradient pattern
- **Baseline Colors**: fbfcfd, c9cacb, 979899, 656667, 333435 (purple gradient progression)
- **Result**: Beautiful baseline lighting with rainbow patterns, no more failsafe lockups

void setCompletePattern() {
    // Beautiful gradient progression
    uint8_t colors[24][3] = {
        {251, 252, 253}, {201, 202, 203}, {151, 152, 153}, // Row 1
        {101, 102, 103}, { 51,  52,  53}, {251, 252, 253}, // Continue pattern...
        // ... define all 24 button colors
    };

        for (int button = 0; button < 24; button++) {
            int hue = (button * 15 + offset) % 360;
            uint8_t r, g, b;
            hsvToRgb(hue, 255, 255, &r, &g, &b);
            setButtonColor(button + 1, r, g, b);

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**"Device goes into static/failsafe mode"**
- ✅ **SOLVED**: This was the major breakthrough - complete LED state management prevents this
- The device requires all 24 buttons to have defined colors, not just individual buttons

**"Button X lights up Button Y instead"**
- ✅ **SOLVED**: Button mapping corrected through protocol analysis
- Ensure Command 3 structure includes the critical 0x00 byte for Button 18

**"LED commands not working"**
- Verify all 5 commands in sequence are sent
- Check Command 3 structure: must include Button 18 G component (0x00)
- Monitor serial output for command confirmation

**"Baseline lighting not appearing"**
- Ensure complete 24-button color array is properly defined
- Verify gradient progression: fbfcfd → c9cacb → 979899 → 656667 → 333435
